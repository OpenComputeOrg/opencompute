# 🌍 OpenCompute — The Open Research Compute Network

**OpenCompute** is a community-driven, open-source platform that connects volunteers who want to share their unused computing power with universities, schools, and medical research organizations that need affordable compute resources.

Our mission is to **democratize access to distributed computing** for education and scientific research — securely, transparently, and ethically.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🖥️ **Volunteer Registration:** Users register their device and share spare CPU/GPU resources.
- 🔬 **Research Compute Pool:** Verified institutions can submit compute tasks through a transparent dashboard.
- 🧩 **Secure Sandboxing:** Every task runs in isolated containers (Docker or WASM).
- 🏆 **Impact Tracking:** Volunteers earn open “impact points” and contribution badges.
- 📊 **Open Data API:** Research usage and compute stats are publicly visible.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

High-performance computing should not be limited to wealthy institutions.  
OpenCompute aims to make computing power **as accessible as open knowledge** — enabling researchers, teachers, and students everywhere to participate in global scientific progress.

Existing distributed systems like BOINC are powerful but outdated. OpenCompute is designed to be **modern, modular, and education-first**.

## 🧩 Vision

> “To build the world’s first open, ethical compute commons — where anyone can contribute to science.”
